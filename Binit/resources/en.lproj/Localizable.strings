It was an interesting journey of discovery, learning all the ins and outs of waste management rules. We even didn't know where to properly dispose of glass (no throwing it down the garbage chute, that's for sure!). It may sound a little funny, but hey, we had never experienced anything like this before!";

We created the app to bring like-minded people together, helping everyone understand Canadian waste management and spreading awareness about the positive environmental impact of sorting. Every action counts, and together we can make a positive impact on the planet!
Join us on this journey for a cleaner, greener future.

P.S. Please, don't be super judgmental, we are only two on the team and it's our first version, but we really wait and appreciate your feedback.";
